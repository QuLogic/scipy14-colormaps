Title:
How to choose a good colour map

Abstract:

Representing data through colours is a very common approach to conveying
important information to an audience.  This is done throughout all fields in
the scientific community and stakes a claim in the commercial and marketing
realm as well.  Colour maps and contour maps are the preferred way for
scientists to visualise three-dimensional data in two dimensions.  Research has
shown that the choice of colourmap is crucial since the human brain
interpolates hue poorly.  We suggest some best practices scientists should
consider when deciding how they should present their results.  Specifically, we
look at some examples of colourmaps that can easily be misinterpreted, making
reference to an in-depth supportive study, and suggest alternative approaches
to improve them.  We conclude by listing some open source tools that aid making
good colourmap choices.  Kristen Thyng's talk on perception of colourmaps in
matplotlib is an excellent follow-on from this.
