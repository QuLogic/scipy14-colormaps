Title:
How to choose a good colour map

Abstract:
Representing data through colours is a very common approach to conveying
important information to an audience.  This is done throughout all fields of
science and stakes a claim in the commerical and marketing realm as well.  In
this talk, we suggest some best practices scientists should consider when
deciding how they should present their results.  We look at some examples of
colourmaps that can easily be misinterpreted, making reference to an in-depth
study conducted by Rogowitz and Treinish [1].  We conclude by suggesting some
best practices scientists should consider while choosing how to represent their
results and we list some open source tools that aid making such choices.
